                <li>
                    <p> You will not be able to install a memory card and you will not need it as the phone's storage space is large. You will need to buy the charger, S Pen and case separately. It does not support the 3.5 mm headphone jack as usual with
                        flagship phones.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>We wished that the battery would be developed, whether in capacity or charging speed. Very good performance from the cameras, but the camera hardware has not been developed over the previous generation. The external screen.</p>
